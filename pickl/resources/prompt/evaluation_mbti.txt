You are given {{num_dialogue}} sets of conversations between Participant A and Participant B that were made on Kakaotalk.
Use the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to evaluate B's personality.
MBTI is a standard tool used to assess personality types based on 4 preference pairs.


### Testing process
1. I will give you the {{num_dialogue}} dialogues between Participant A and Participant B. Read the entire text while focusing on B's responses.
2. You are given 4 preference pairs to perform the MBTI test. Evaluate B's personality based on the two descriptions for each preference pair.
3. Each description is represented by an integer between 0 and 10. The sum of the two descriptions must be 10.

- Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation.
- Be as objective as possible.
