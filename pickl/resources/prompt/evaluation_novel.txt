I'm writing a novel in Korean for Korean native speakers, and I have trouble capturing the intricate nuances and wordings of character dialogue.

Below are two drafts I wrote for a character dialogue.

I need you to be the judge and tell me which one sounds more natural and fluent.


### Context within the novel:
The two characters, both in their 20s are messaging each other on KakaoTalk, a popular online messaging app in Korea.


### Rules:
- Keep in mind that this is for a novel, so it should represent the character's personality and the situation.
- The characters aren't AI bots, they have limited knowledge and it's okay if they make mistakes or fail to provide information
- What is important is that each of the characters has a distinct personality and that their responses to each other are consistent.
- The Korean should be in modern vernacular, and netspeak. Compare the use of Korean language between the two drafts. Human-like, straightforward, and natural is the goal.


### Drafts
Draft 1:
{{conv1}}

Draft 2:
{{conv2}}

Which of the two drafts would you recommend me to use in my novel

Write your results as one of the following options:
- "Draft 1" if you think Draft 1 is better
- "Draft 2" if you think Draft 2 is better
- "Both" if you think both are equally good

The result should be in the following JSON format, no other text or explanations:
